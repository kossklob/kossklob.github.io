			In the Winter of my Sophomore year, my <a href="html2.html">waterpolo</a> teammates and I traveled to <span style="color:gold">Oahu, Hawaii.</span>
		</p>
		<img src="HawaiiSunset.jpg" border="5" alt="Oahu Sunset" class="center">
		<p>
			Here's an image of the sunset on our very first night! It was definetly an unforgettable experience. Just to the right of this area was a ledge that the locals would jump off of into the ocean!
		</p>
		<p>
			By far my favorite memory of this day was watching my teammates attempt this <a href="html3.html">cliff jump.</a> I specifically remember Sean running and jumping off and then being stuck out in the water for a few minutes due to the tide suddenly acting up.
