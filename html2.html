	<h1>Waterpolo!</h1>
	<p class="center large">and my relationship to the sport</p>
	<div style="background-color:orange">
		<p>
			I first began playing <span style="color:gold">waterpolo</span> when I was an incoming highschool freshman at Santa Barbara. I wasn't very good when I first started but I quickly grew better due to my prior experience as a member of the swim team.

			Above is an image of me as a member of the CMS waterpolo team. This year we are ranked as third in the nation in division three and are hopeful that we will be able to bring home the national championship. I hope that I'll be able to lead the team as I have the past two years from the defensive front.

			Maybe my biggest accomplishment thus far as a waterpolo player was finishing second place twice at the Junior Olympics. For someone who has been playing the sport for a relatively short period of time, to be invited to compete at that high of a level is an extreme privilege.
